# MINECRAFTGOLDFISH3 Proxy

This is a proxy I was developing using chemicaljs. It includes games, apps, and cheats. I cannot deploy it somewhere as proxies violate the terms of service on most web services.

<b>Note:</b> All the games, apps, and cheats are not found in this repository, those are all in the [assets](https://github.com/MINECRAFTGOLDFISH3/assets) repository.

## Usage

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
